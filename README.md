# Collatz
Problem description: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collatz_conjecture

Numbers are tested, whether they follow the Collatz conjecture (even: n*2; odd: n*3+1; eventually ends up at 1).  
This script prints to an output file that contains the tested number and the necessary steps to reach 1.

Amount of turns, start number and end number can be selected at will.

If output file already exists new numbers are appended to the output file.
